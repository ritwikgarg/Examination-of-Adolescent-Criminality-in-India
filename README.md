# Examination-of-Adolescent-Criminality-in-India

The main objective of the project is to use the Crime-In-India dataset from Kaggle to predict and categorize the Indian states and union territories based on their level of awareness regarding juvenile delinquency. 

The project will analyze the juvenile crime statistics for a 10-year period (2001-2010) and classify each state or UT into one of four classes based on their level of awareness against juvenile crimes: Relaxed-Awareness-Required, Focused-Awareness-Required, High-Awareness-Required, and Alarmingly-High-Awareness-Required. This classification is important because the lack of awareness in society about juvenile delinquency is a major challenge for Indian society that needs immediate attention.

The dataset provides complete information about various aspects of crimes committed in India between 2001 and 2010, including a link between crime rates and the education level of juveniles who committed crimes. 

The K-Nearest-Neighbors Classification technique is used to classify the states and union territories, and the project includes visualization for both the dataset and the final evaluated results. Ultimately, this project aims to raise awareness of the need for stricter vigilance and awareness against juvenile delinquency in Indian states and union territories based on their juvenile crime statistics.
